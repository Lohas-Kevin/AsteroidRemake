# AsteroidRemake
 
This is a practice remake project of Asteroid.
To start the game in editor: go to StartScene and click the play

What Features this game has:
- The player should control the ship with WASD or arrow keys. Both should be available at all times. 
- The player should be able to shoot by pressing the spacebar. A press is considered a "full press" when the player releases the spacebar.
- There should be screen wrapping. The player ship and asteroids should travel to the opposite side of the screen when approaching the border.
- When the player is touched by an asteroid they die. 
-When an asteroid is hit by a bullet, it should split into a smaller chunk. Asteroids should be considered to come in 3 sizes, the smallest of which does not divide but instead disappears. 
- The player gets points when it destroys an asteroid.
- The player has three lives
- Game over takes you to a game over screen, then to a high scores screen and then the main menu.
- The player should earn points when destroying an asteroid. Those points should be configurable outside of the code. 
- The players score is shown at all times in the UI. When the game ends, a ranking on the best scores should be shown, just the amount is sufficient. 
- Asteroids rotate on their own axis in random directions.
- Drag on the player ship when moving.
